        <b><u> Berners-Lee </u></b> considered HTML to be an application of<mark>
          SGML</mark
        >. It was formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task
        Force (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an
        HTML specification, the
        <ins>"Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)"</ins> Internet Draft by
        Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML Document type
        definition to define the syntax.[9][10] The draft expired after six
        months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic
        browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's
        philosophy of<code> basing standards on successful prototypes</code>.
        Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext
        Markup Format)", <mark>from late 1993</mark>, suggested standardizing
        already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms. X<sup
